# Introduction

This project was made just for demo/learning purposes. You can fork it, edit, share it! Hope it turns useful for beginners like me.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Run after the install completes. It runs the project on a local development server and listens for changes in your code. It opens a tab on your browser as well.
